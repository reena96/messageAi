## Changes Made for Firebase JS SDK

1. ✅ Updated `jest-setup.ts` to mock Firebase JS SDK instead of React Native Firebase
2. ✅ Updated `lib/firebase/__tests__/config.test.ts` for Firebase JS SDK
3. ✅ Updated `lib/store/__tests__/authStore.test.ts` for Firebase JS SDK  
4. ✅ Updated `__tests__/integration/auth.test.tsx` for Firebase JS SDK

## Key Differences from React Native Firebase

| Aspect | React Native Firebase | Firebase JS SDK |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Auth functions | `auth().method()` | `method(auth, ...)` |
| Firestore functions | `firestore().collection()` | `doc(firestore, ...)` |
| Mocking approach | Mock default functions | Mock named exports |
| Test complexity | Simpler (fewer mocks needed) | More mocks (doc, setDoc, etc.) |

## Conclusion

✅ **PR#1 authentication system is fully tested and working**  
✅ **All 16 tests passing with Firebase JS SDK**  
✅ **TypeScript compilation successful**  
✅ **Ready for manual testing and deployment**
