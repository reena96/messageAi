# PR #8: RSVP Tracking + Deadline Extraction + Quick Actions - Validation Plan

**PR:** RSVP Tracking + Deadline Extraction + Quick Actions
**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Testing

**Key Rubric Requirements:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** RSVP accuracy: **>90%** (rubric requirement)
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Deadline accuracy: **>90%** (rubric requirement)
- ✅ Response time: **<3 seconds** (5-feature parallel extraction)
- ✅ Non-blocking message send
- ✅ Parent-friendly UX with one-tap quick actions
- ✅ Related items linking (RSVP ↔ Calendar events)

## Key Features

### 1. RSVP Tracking
- **Invitation Detection:** Detects event invitations with event name, details, and response tracking
- **Response Detection:** Detects RSVP responses (yes/no/maybe) with 70% confidence threshold
- **Related Items Linking:** Links RSVP invitations to calendar events when both are detected
- **Quick Actions:** One-tap RSVP buttons (Yes/No/Maybe) for recipients only (host doesn't see buttons)
- **Visual Design:** Compact response cards with color-coded badges (green/red/orange)

### 2. Deadline Extraction
- **Task Extraction:** Extracts task description, due date, due time, and assigned people
- **Priority Classification:** Categorizes as high/medium/low based on urgency, importance, and impact
- **Overdue Detection:** Highlights overdue deadlines in red with countdown/overdue text
- **Quick Actions:** One-tap "Mark Done" button to complete deadlines in Firestore
- **Completion Tracking:** completed: boolean field for deadline status

### 3. Quick Actions
- **Add to Calendar:** Opens native calendar app (iOS/Android) with pre-filled event details
- **Mark Done:** Updates Firestore to mark deadline as complete
- **Send RSVP:** Sends RSVP response message to chat ("I'll be there!", "Sorry, can't make it", etc.)
- **Platform Support:** iOS calendar URL scheme + Android calendar intent
- **Error Handling:** Fallback alerts if native calendar unavailable

### 4. 5-Feature Parallel Extraction
- **Parallel Processing:** All 5 AI features run simultaneously (calendar, decisions, priority, RSVP, deadlines)
- **Non-blocking:** Message send completes immediately, extraction happens in background
- **Related Items:** RSVP invitations automatically linked to calendar events
- **Performance:** <3 seconds total extraction time

5. **Requirement:** Must be >90%

**Expected Results:**
- Invitations: 18/20 or better (90%+)
- Responses: 18/20 or better (90%+)

### Deadline Accuracy Target: >90%

**Test Method:**
1. Send 20 deadline messages
2. Verify correct task, date, time, priority extraction
3. Count correct detections
4. Calculate: (Correct / Total) × 100%
5. **Requirement:** Must be >90%

**Expected Results:**
- Task extraction: 18/20 or better (90%+)
- Date parsing: 18/20 or better (90%+)
- Priority classification: 18/20 or better (90%+)

---

## Performance Validation

### Response Time Target: <3 seconds

**Test Method:**
1. Send message with multiple features (calendar + RSVP + deadline)
2. Measure time from message send to all cards appearing
3. **Requirement:** Must be <3 seconds

**Expected Results:**
- Message send: Immediate (<100ms)
- Parallel extraction: <3 seconds total
- Card rendering: <100ms after extraction

## Regression Testing (Previous PRs)

- [ ] **PR#1 (Messaging):** Basic send/receive still works
- [ ] **PR#3 (Offline):** Offline queue + sync still works
- [ ] **PR#4 (Calendar Tab):** Calendar events still appear in Calendar tab
- [ ] **PR#6 (Calendar Extraction):** Calendar extraction still works
- [ ] **PR#7 (Decisions + Priority):** Decision cards + priority cards still work
- [ ] **PR#7 Bugfix Applied:** All aiExtraction fields mapped in real-time listener AND pagination

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **Calendar Integration:** Opens native calendar but doesn't pre-fill event details (iOS/Android limitation)
2. **RSVP Counts:** Response tracking counts (yes: 5, no: 2) not yet implemented (future enhancement)
3. **Deadline Assignment:** Assigned people extraction works but no UI to show assignees yet
4. **Time Parsing:** Complex time formats may need refinement ("quarter past 3" not supported)

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Calendar Tab:** Show deadlines in Calendar tab with filtering
2. **RSVP Aggregation:** Show total response counts for invitations
3. **Deadline Notifications:** Push notifications for upcoming deadlines
4. **Recurring Events:** Support for recurring invitations/deadlines
