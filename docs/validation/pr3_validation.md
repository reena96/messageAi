**Branch:** `pr3_core_messaging`
**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Devices Required:** 2 (for real-time testing)

---

## 📋 Quick Reference

### What's Being Tested:
- ✅ Real-time message sending/receiving
- ✅ Optimistic UI (instant message display)
- ✅ Typing indicators
- ✅ Read receipts
- ✅ **Performance: <200ms delivery** ⭐ **RUBRIC CRITICAL**

### Test Status Template:
```
[ ] Not Started
[~] In Progress
[✓] Passed
[✗] Failed
```

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Ensure you have a .env file with Firebase credentials
cat .env

# Should show:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
# EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
# etc.

# Start the development server with cleared cache
npx expo start --clear
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Starting Metro Bundler
Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:8081
Scan QR code with Expo Go
```

### 2. Device Setup

You'll need **TWO devices/sessions** to test real-time messaging:

**Option A: Two Physical Devices** (Recommended)
- iPhone + Android phone
- Both with Expo Go installed
- Both on same WiFi network

**Option B: Two Simulators/Emulators**
- iOS Simulator + Android Emulator
- Or two iOS Simulators (different device types)

**Option C: Mixed Setup**
- One physical device + one simulator

### 3. User Accounts

Create two test user accounts:
```
User 1: testuser1@example.com / password123
User 2: testuser2@example.com / password123
```

**Steps to create:**
1. Open app on Device 1
2. Sign up with User 1 credentials
3. Note the UID from Firebase Console → Authentication
4. Open app on Device 2
5. Sign up with User 2 credentials
6. Note the UID

---

## Phase 1: Create a Test Chat (Setup)

Since we haven't implemented the "create chat" UI yet, you'll need to create a test chat manually in Firebase Console.

### 1.1 Open Firebase Console

```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messageai-fc793/firestore
```

### 1.2 Get User UIDs

1. [ ] Navigate to **Authentication** tab
2. [ ] Copy UID for testuser1@example.com → `user1_uid`
3. [ ] Copy UID for testuser2@example.com → `user2_uid`

Example UIDs:
```
user1_uid: "abc123xyz456"
user2_uid: "def789uvw012"
```

### 1.3 Create Test Chat Document

1. [ ] Navigate to **Firestore Database**
2. [ ] Click on `chats` collection (create if doesn't exist)
3. [ ] Click **"Add document"**
4. [ ] Document ID: `test-chat-1` (or auto-generate)
5. [ ] Add the following fields:

```javascript
{
  type: "one-on-one",
  participants: ["user1_uid", "user2_uid"],  // Replace with actual UIDs
  participantDetails: {
    "user1_uid": {
      displayName: "Test User 1",
      photoURL: null
    },
    "user2_uid": {
      displayName: "Test User 2",
      photoURL: null
    }
  },
  unreadCount: {
    "user1_uid": 0,
    "user2_uid": 0
  },
  createdBy: "user1_uid",
  createdAt: [Timestamp: now],
  updatedAt: [Timestamp: now]
}
```

**Field Types:**
- `type`: string
- `participants`: array
- `participantDetails`: map
- `unreadCount`: map
- `createdBy`: string
- `createdAt`: timestamp
- `updatedAt`: timestamp

6. [ ] Click **Save**
7. [ ] **VERIFY**: Chat document appears in Firestore

---

## Phase 2: Access the Chat Screen

### 2.1 Navigate to Chat via Chat List

**On Device 1 (logged in as User 1):**
1. [ ] Open the app
2. [ ] Navigate to **Chats** tab (bottom navigation)
3. [ ] **VERIFY**: See "Test User 2" in chat list
4. [ ] Tap on the chat
5. [ ] **VERIFY**: Chat screen opens with title "Chats"

**Expected Chat List Item:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ T  Test User 2              │
│    No messages yet          │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Alternative: Manual URL Navigation (Debug Only)

If chat doesn't appear in list, manually navigate:

**Using React Native Debugger:**
```javascript
// Open debugger console
const { router } = require('expo-router');
router.push('/chat/test-chat-1');
```

---

## Phase 3: Core Messaging Tests

### Test 3.1: Send First Message ✅

**On Device 1 (User 1):**

1. [ ] **VERIFY**: Chat screen shows:
   - Empty state: "No messages yet"
   - Input field at bottom
   - Send button (disabled)

2. [ ] Type message: `"Hello from User 1!"`

3. [ ] **VERIFY**: Send button becomes enabled (blue)

4. [ ] Click **Send** button

5. [ ] **VERIFY IMMEDIATELY** (within 100ms):
   - Message appears instantly
   - Blue bubble (right-aligned)
   - Text: "Hello from User 1!"
   - Timestamp shows current time
   - Status: `○` (circle = sending)

6. [ ] **VERIFY** (within 1 second):
   - Status changes to `✓` (checkmark = sent)
   - Input field cleared
   - Send button disabled again
   - Chat scrolled to bottom

7. [ ] **VERIFY in Firebase Console**:
   - Navigate to `/chats/test-chat-1/messages`
   - New message document exists
   - Fields:
     ```javascript
     {
       chatId: "test-chat-1",
       senderId: "user1_uid",
       text: "Hello from User 1!",
       timestamp: [Firestore Timestamp],
       status: "sent",
       readBy: ["user1_uid"],
       type: "text"
     }
     ```

8. [ ] **VERIFY** in chat document `/chats/test-chat-1`:
   - `lastMessage.text`: "Hello from User 1!"
   - `lastMessage.senderId`: "user1_uid"
   - `lastMessage.timestamp`: [recent timestamp]
   - `updatedAt`: [recent timestamp]

**Expected Behavior:**
```
✓ Message appears instantly (optimistic UI)
✓ Send button disabled when empty
✓ Input clears after sending
✓ Auto-scroll to bottom
✓ Status progression: ○ → ✓
```

**Performance Check:**
9. [ ] Open React Native Debugger console
10. [ ] Look for performance log:
    ```
    ✅ Performance: Message Send Time took XXms
    ```
11. [ ] **VERIFY**: Duration < 200ms ⭐ **RUBRIC CRITICAL**

---

### Test 3.2: Real-Time Message Sync ✅

5. [ ] **VERIFY IMMEDIATELY**:
   - Message "Hello from User 1!" appears
   - Gray bubble (left-aligned)
   - Correct timestamp
   - NO status indicator (only on own messages)

6. [ ] Type reply: `"Hi back from User 2!"`
7. [ ] Click **Send**

8. [ ] **VERIFY** (no refresh needed):
   - Reply appears instantly
   - Gray bubble (left-aligned)
   - Text: "Hi back from User 2!"
   - Correct timestamp

9. [ ] **VERIFY** on own message:
   - Status changed to `✓✓` (double checkmark = delivered)
   - Still blue color (not read yet)

**Expected Behavior:**
```
✓ Messages sync in real-time
✓ No page refresh needed
✓ Correct bubble colors (blue=own, gray=other)
✓ Correct alignment (right=own, left=other)
✓ Delivered status shows on sent messages
```

---

### Test 3.3: Typing Indicators ✅

**On Device 1 (User 1):**

1. [ ] Start typing a message: `"Testing typing indicators..."`

✓ No manual refresh needed
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "No messages appearing"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Firestore rules blocking reads
2. User not authenticated
3. Wrong chatId

**Debug Steps:**
```bash
# Check Firestore rules
Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules

# Should see:
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}

# Check authentication
# In React Native Debugger:
const { useAuthStore } = require('@/lib/store/authStore');
console.log(useAuthStore.getState().user);
// Should show user object with uid

# Verify chatId
# Check URL or navigation params
```

---

### Issue: "Typing indicator not showing"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Firestore rules blocking writes to chat document
2. Timeout cleared too quickly
3. Network latency

**Debug Steps:**
```bash
# Check Firebase Console
Navigate to /chats/{chatId}
Look for `typing` field

# Should see:
typing: {
  "user1_uid": Timestamp
}

# Check console for errors:
# "Error setting typing:"
```

---

### Issue: "Read receipts not working"

**Possible Causes:**
1. User not viewing chat (still in background)
2. Message already marked as read
3. Firestore rules

**Debug Steps:**
```bash
# Check message document
Navigate to /chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}
Look at `readBy` array

# Should contain viewing user's UID

# Check console:
# "Error marking as read:"
```

---

### Issue: "Performance >200ms"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Slow network connection
2. Firebase region far from user
3. Large message payload

**Debug Steps:**
```bash
# Check network speed
# Use cellular data vs WiFi
# Try different WiFi network

# Check Firebase Console location
Firebase Console → Project Settings → Default GCP resource location

# Optimize:
# - Use WiFi instead of cellular
# - Check for background apps using bandwidth
# - Test during off-peak hours
```

---

### Issue: "Failed messages not recovering"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Messages only retry on new sends
2. Firestore offline persistence disabled

**Debug Steps:**
```bash
# Failed messages stay failed (by design)
# User needs to manually retry by sending a new message

# To implement retry:
# Add retry button to failed messages (future enhancement)
```
