## 🐛 Bugs Encountered & Fixes

### Bug #1: OpenAI JSON Response Format Mismatch

**Issue:**
Cloud Function was returning `{"events":[],"error":"Failed to parse AI response"}` even though OpenAI was successfully extracting events.

**Root Cause:**
OpenAI's `response_format: {type: "json_object"}` requires the response to be a JSON object, not an array. Our system prompt was asking for a plain array `[...]` but OpenAI was returning an object.

**Error Logs:**
```
2025-10-24 16:51:49.420 PDT
Error: Failed to parse OpenAI response
  at /workspace/lib/ai/calendarExtraction.js:122:30
```

**Fix:**
Changed the system prompt from:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Wrong)
"Return as JSON array with fields: event, date, time, location, confidence."
Examples:
Output: [{"event": "Soccer practice", ...}]
```

To:
```typescript
// AFTER (Correct)
"Return a JSON object with an 'events' array. Each event has: event, date, time, location, confidence."
Examples:
Output: {"events": [{"event": "Soccer practice", ...}]}
```

**File:** `functions/src/ai/calendarExtraction.ts:24-43`

**Learning:**
When using OpenAI's `response_format: {type: "json_object"}`, always structure prompts to return objects with named properties, not bare arrays.

### Bug #2: Expo Incompatibility with @react-native-firebase/functions

**Issue:**
After installing `@react-native-firebase/functions`, pod install failed with:
```
Invalid `RNFBFunctions.podspec` file: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - ../app/package.json
```

**Root Cause:**
`@react-native-firebase/functions` package expects a bare React Native project structure with an `app/` directory. Expo projects have a different structure and the package's podspec was looking for files in the wrong location.

**Attempted Fix #1: npx expo prebuild --clean**
- Result: Failed with same error
- Why: The package's podspec is hardcoded to look for `../app/package.json`

**Successful Fix:**
Switched from React Native Firebase to Firebase JS SDK:
```bash
# Remove incompatible package
npm uninstall @react-native-firebase/functions

# Firebase JS SDK already installed (works with Expo)
npm install firebase  # Already present
```

Changed import in `lib/ai/calendar.ts`:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Incompatible with Expo)
import functions from '@react-native-firebase/functions';
const calendarExtraction = functions().httpsCallable('calendarExtraction');

// AFTER (Expo-compatible)
import { getFunctions, httpsCallable } from 'firebase/functions';
import app from '@/lib/firebase/config';
const functions = getFunctions(app);
const calendarExtraction = httpsCallable(functions, 'calendarExtraction');
```

**Files Changed:**
- `lib/ai/calendar.ts:1-17, 37`

**Learning:**
For Expo projects, prefer Firebase JS SDK over React Native Firebase packages when possible. The JS SDK has better Expo compatibility and doesn't require native code changes.

**Documentation:**
- Firebase JS SDK for Cloud Functions: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable
- React Native Firebase is better for bare React Native projects, not Expo

### Bug #3: UTC Timezone Issue - Dates Off by One Day

**Issue:**
Calendar events were showing dates one day earlier than expected:
- User types: "Dentist **Monday** at 2pm"
- Calendar shows: "**Sun**, Oct 26" ❌
- User types: "Soccer **Wednesday** at 5pm"
- Calendar shows: "**Tue**, Oct 28" ❌

**Root Cause:**
JavaScript's `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")` constructor parses ISO date strings as UTC midnight. When converted to local timezone (PST/PDT = UTC-8), the date shifts to the previous day.

**Example:**
```javascript
// User in PST (UTC-8)
const date = new Date("2025-10-28"); // Parses as 2025-10-28T00:00:00Z (UTC)
console.log(date.toString());
// Output: "Mon Oct 27 2025 16:00:00 GMT-0800" (Previous day!)
```

**Fix:**
Parse ISO date strings manually in local timezone:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Bug - parses as UTC)
const formatDate = (dateString: string) => {
  const date = new Date(dateString); // ❌ Treats as UTC
  // ...
};

// AFTER (Fixed - parses as local)
const formatDate = (dateString: string) => {
  // Parse in LOCAL timezone, not UTC
  const [year, month, day] = dateString.split('-').map(Number);
  const date = new Date(year, month - 1, day); // ✅ Local timezone
  // month is 0-indexed, so subtract 1
  // ...
};
```

Also fixed event sorting:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Bug)
allEvents.sort((a, b) => {
  const dateA = new Date(a.event.date); // ❌ UTC
  const dateB = new Date(b.event.date); // ❌ UTC
  return dateA.getTime() - dateB.getTime();
});

// AFTER (Fixed)
allEvents.sort((a, b) => {
  const [yearA, monthA, dayA] = a.event.date.split('-').map(Number);
  const [yearB, monthB, dayB] = b.event.date.split('-').map(Number);
  const dateA = new Date(yearA, monthA - 1, dayA); // ✅ Local
  const dateB = new Date(yearB, monthB - 1, dayB); // ✅ Local
  return dateA.getTime() - dateB.getTime();
});
```

**Files Changed:**
- `app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx:118-145` (formatDate function)
- `app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx:90-96` (sorting)

**Learning:**
When working with ISO date strings (YYYY-MM-DD) that represent dates without times:
- ❌ **NEVER** use `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")` - it parses as UTC
- ✅ **ALWAYS** parse manually: `new Date(year, month-1, day)` - uses local timezone
- This ensures dates display correctly across all timezones

**Why This Matters:**
Calendar dates are "wall clock" dates (Oct 28 is Oct 28 everywhere), not moments in time. Using UTC for calendar dates causes timezone-dependent bugs.

## 🎯 Performance Optimizations

### Optimization #1: Non-Blocking AI Extraction

**Implementation:**
AI extraction runs as a fire-and-forget promise after message send:
```typescript
// Message sends immediately (optimistic UI)
const docRef = await addDoc(messagesRef, messageData);
const messageId = docRef.id;

// AI extraction runs in background (non-blocking)
extractCalendarEvents(text)
  .then((events) => {
    if (events.length > 0) {
      // Update message with extraction results
      updateDoc(messageRef, { 'aiExtraction.calendarEvents': events });
    }
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log('AI extraction failed (non-critical):', err);
  });

// Continue with chat updates without waiting
await updateDoc(chatRef, updates);
```

**Results:**
- Message send: 370ms (target <200ms, slightly over but acceptable)
- AI extraction: ~1.5s (runs in parallel, doesn't block UI)
- User sees message immediately, events appear 2-3 seconds later

**File:** `lib/store/messageStore.ts:299-325`

---

### Optimization #2: Efficient Calendar Event Loading

**Challenge:**
Need to query messages with calendar events across all user's chats without loading every message.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// 1. Query user's chats
const chatsQuery = query(
  collection(firestore, 'chats'),
  where('participants', 'array-contains', user.uid)
);

// 2. For each chat, query ONLY messages with AI extraction
const messagesQuery = query(
  collection(firestore, 'chats', chatId, 'messages'),
  where('aiExtraction.calendarEvents', '!=', null) // Firestore index required
);
```

**Benefits:**
- Only loads messages that have calendar events (not all messages)
- Real-time updates when new events are extracted
- Scales well with large chat histories

**File:** `app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx:36-82`

**Note:** Requires Firestore composite index:
- Collection: `messages`
- Fields: `aiExtraction.calendarEvents (!=), timestamp (desc)`

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Decision #1: Callable vs Trigger Cloud Functions

**Options Considered:**
1. **Callable Function** (chosen) - Client calls function directly
2. **Firestore Trigger** - Function triggers on message creation

**Decision: Callable Function**

**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Better error handling - client receives errors immediately
- ✅ Retry logic - client can retry failed extractions
- ✅ Cost control - client decides when to extract (can add pre-filtering)
- ✅ Debugging - easier to test and log from client
- ❌ Requires client-side code - but we already have messageStore pattern

**If we had chosen Trigger:**
- ✅ Automatic - no client code needed
- ❌ No retry logic - failures are silent
- ❌ Harder to debug - errors only in Cloud Function logs
- ❌ Less control - runs for every message regardless of content

**File:** `functions/src/ai/calendarExtraction.ts:49-56`

---

### Decision #2: OpenAI Model Selection

**Options:**
1. GPT-4 Turbo (chosen) - `gpt-4-turbo-preview`
2. GPT-3.5 Turbo - `gpt-3.5-turbo`
3. GPT-4 - `gpt-4`

**Decision: GPT-4 Turbo**

**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Best accuracy for complex date parsing ("next Tuesday", "2 weeks from now")
- ✅ JSON mode support - structured output
- ✅ Faster than GPT-4, more accurate than GPT-3.5
- ✅ Better at handling ambiguous dates
- ❌ More expensive (~$0.01-0.02 per message)

**Configuration:**
```typescript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
  temperature: 0.3, // More deterministic (less random)
  response_format: {type: "json_object"}, // Structured output
  max_tokens: 500, // Cost control
});
```

**Cost Analysis:**
- Average: $0.012 per extraction
- Assuming 10% of messages have events
- 1000 users × 50 messages/day = 50,000 messages
- 5,000 extractions/day × $0.012 = **$60/day = $1,800/month**

**Future Optimization:**
- Add client-side keyword filtering before API call
- Use GPT-3.5 for simple cases, GPT-4 for complex
- Cache common event patterns

**File:** `functions/src/ai/calendarExtraction.ts:78-88`

## 🧪 Testing Insights

### Test Strategy

**Unit Tests (Planned - Task 7):**
- Calendar extraction accuracy (>90% requirement)
- Performance (<2s response time)
- Edge cases (vague dates, non-events, multiple events)

**Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end: Message send → AI extraction → Firestore update
- Calendar UI: Real-time updates, sorting, navigation

**Manual Testing (Completed):**
- ✅ Single event extraction
- ✅ Multiple events in one message
- ✅ Non-events (no false positives)
- ✅ Calendar tab display
- ✅ Timezone correctness
- ✅ Navigation to source chat

## 📖 Key Learnings

### 1. OpenAI API Best Practices
- Always use `response_format: {type: "json_object"}` for structured data
- Keep temperature low (0.2-0.3) for deterministic parsing tasks
- Provide clear examples in system prompt
- Validate and filter responses on confidence scores

### 2. Firebase Cloud Functions
- Use Secret Manager for API keys (not environment variables)
- Set appropriate timeouts (30s for AI calls)
- Log extensively for debugging
- Handle errors gracefully (return empty, don't throw)

### 3. Expo + Firebase Integration
- Prefer Firebase JS SDK over React Native Firebase for Expo projects
- Some React Native Firebase packages are incompatible with Expo
- Use `npx expo prebuild` cautiously - not all packages work

### 4. JavaScript Date Handling
- ISO date strings parse as UTC by default
- Always parse dates manually for "wall clock" dates
- Normalize to midnight when comparing dates
- Test across timezones (UTC, PST, EST)

### 5. Real-time Firestore Queries
- Use compound queries to filter data efficiently
- Subscribe to multiple collections carefully (memory leaks)
- Always return cleanup functions from useEffect
- Consider Firestore index requirements

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

### Short-term (Next PR):
1. Add client-side keyword filtering before AI call (cost reduction)
2. Implement "Add to Calendar" button (sync to device calendar)
3. Scroll to source message when tapping calendar event
4. Show loading state while extraction is in progress

### Medium-term:
1. Batch multiple messages in single AI call (cost optimization)
2. Cache common event patterns (reduce API calls)
3. Add conflict detection ("You have 2 events at 3pm")
4. Support recurring events ("Every Monday at 4pm")

### Long-term:
1. Use GPT-3.5 for simple cases, GPT-4 for complex (hybrid approach)
2. Train custom model on user's event patterns
3. Offline extraction using on-device ML (ML Kit, TensorFlow Lite)
4. Multi-language support

## 🛠️ Debugging Tips for Future Developers

### Issue: AI extraction not triggering
**Check:**
1. Console logs: Look for `[AI] 🚀 Starting calendar extraction`
2. Cloud Function logs: `firebase functions:log --only calendarExtraction`
3. Network tab: Check if Cloud Function is being called
4. Firestore rules: Ensure function can write to messages collection

### Issue: Events not appearing in Calendar tab
**Check:**
1. Firestore: Verify `aiExtraction.calendarEvents` field exists on message
2. Console logs: Look for `[Calendar] ✅ Loaded X calendar events`
3. Firestore query: Ensure composite index is created
4. User participation: Verify user is in the chat

### Issue: Dates showing incorrect day
**Check:**
1. Timezone: Ensure using local timezone parsing (not UTC)
2. Device timezone: Test on device in different timezone
3. Date format: Verify AI returns ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
