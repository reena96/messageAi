# PR1 React Native Firebase Trial - Bug Fixes & Learnings

**Branch:** `pr1_reactNativeFirebase`
**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** INCOMPLETE - Fundamental compatibility issue identified
**Final Decision:** Reverted to Firebase JS SDK on main branch

## Executive Summary

Attempted to implement React Native Firebase as an alternative to Firebase JS SDK for authentication. Successfully migrated all source code and tests, but encountered a fundamental incompatibility between React Native Firebase's requirements and Expo SDK 54's architecture that blocks iOS builds.

**Key Finding:** React Native Firebase requires `use_frameworks!` for Swift pod dependencies, which is incompatible with Expo SDK 54's precompiled XCFrameworks architecture.

---

## Timeline of Issues & Resolutions

### 1. Initial Setup - Package Installation ✅

**What We Did:**
- Uninstalled Firebase JS SDK (`firebase` package)
- Installed React Native Firebase packages:
  - `@react-native-firebase/app@23.4.1`
  - `@react-native-firebase/auth@23.4.1`
  - `@react-native-firebase/firestore@23.4.1`
  - `@react-native-firebase/storage@23.4.1`
  - `@react-native-firebase/messaging@23.4.1`

**Result:** ✅ Successful

---

### 2. Source Code Migration ✅

**What We Did:**
Changed from Firebase JS SDK API to React Native Firebase functional API:

**OLD (JS SDK):**
```typescript
import { getAuth, signInWithEmailAndPassword } from 'firebase/auth';
import { getFirestore, doc, setDoc } from 'firebase/firestore';

const auth = getAuth(app);
await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
await setDoc(doc(firestore, 'users', uid), data);
```

**NEW (RN Firebase):**
```typescript
import auth from '@react-native-firebase/auth';
import firestore from '@react-native-firebase/firestore';

await auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
await firestore().collection('users').doc(uid).set(data);
```

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/firebase/config.ts` - Complete rewrite
- `lib/store/authStore.ts` - API pattern changes
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Auth listener updates
- `types/user.ts` - Import changes
- All test files - Mock pattern updates

**Result:** ✅ All 16 tests passing

---

### 3. Bug #1: React Native Header Import Issues ❌→✅

**Error:**
```
error: unknown type name 'RCT_EXTERN'
error: declaration of 'RCTBridgeModule' must be imported from module 'RNFBApp.RNFBAppModule'
```

**Root Cause:**
React Native Firebase v23.4.1 has compatibility issues with React Native New Architecture - the RNFB* pods couldn't find React Native Core headers.

**Failed Attempt #1:**
Tried disabling New Architecture by setting `"newArchEnabled": false` in:
- `app.json`
- `ios/Podfile.properties.json`

**Why It Failed:**
```
react-native-reanimated v4.x MANDATES New Architecture
Error: assert_new_architecture_enabled($new_arch_enabled)
```

expo-router depends on react-native-reanimated v4+, which has a hard requirement for New Architecture. Cannot be disabled.

**Successful Fix:**
Added header search paths in `ios/Podfile` post_install hook:

```ruby
if target.name.start_with?('RNFB')
  config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] ||= '$(inherited) '
  config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] << '"${PODS_ROOT}/Headers/Public/React-Core" '
  config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] << '"${PODS_CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR}/React-Core/React_Core.framework/Headers" '
  config.build_settings['USER_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] ||= '$(inherited) '
  config.build_settings['USER_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] << '"${PODS_ROOT}/Headers/Public/React-Core" '
end
```

**Result:** ✅ RNFB* targets compile successfully

**Learning:** New Architecture is mandatory in Expo SDK 54 when using expo-router. Any solution must be compatible with New Architecture.

---

### 4. Bug #2: Swift Module Dependencies ❌→✅

**Error:**
```
The Swift pod `FirebaseAuth` depends upon `FirebaseAuthInterop`, `FirebaseAppCheckInterop`,
which do not define modules.
```

**Root Cause:**
Firebase Swift pods cannot integrate as static libraries without modular headers enabled.

**Fix:**
Added to `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
use_frameworks! :linkage => :static
use_modular_headers!
```

**Result:** ✅ CocoaPods installation successful (126 pods)

**Learning:** Firebase Swift dependencies require modular headers to be enabled.

---

### 5. Bug #3: Missing React Native Codegen Files ❌→✅

**Error:**
```
error: /Users/reena/messageAi/ios/build/generated/ios/react/renderer/components/rnscreens/ComponentDescriptors.h: No such file or directory
error: lstat(.../rnscreens/States.h): No such file or directory
error: lstat(.../rnscreens/ShadowNodes.h): No such file or directory
error: lstat(.../rnscreens/Props.h): No such file or directory
error: lstat(.../rnscreens/EventEmitters.h): No such file or directory
error: lstat(.../rnscreens/RCTComponentViewHelpers.h): No such file or directory
```

**Root Cause:**
The Xcode build phase `[Expo Autolinking] Run Codegen with autolinking` was running but not successfully generating codegen artifacts for react-native-screens and other New Architecture components.

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Found the codegen script in Podfile
grep -A 30 "Expo Autolinking" ios/Pods/Pods.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj

# Script was present but output directory didn't exist
ls ios/build/generated/ios/
# No such file or directory
```

**Fix:**
Manually ran the React Native codegen script:

```bash
node node_modules/react-native/scripts/generate-codegen-artifacts.js \
  --path "/Users/reena/messageAi" \
  --outputPath "/Users/reena/messageAi/ios" \
  --targetPlatform "ios"
```

**Output:**
```
[Codegen] Found react-native-screens
[Codegen] Generating Native Code for rnscreens - ios
[Codegen] Generated artifacts: /Users/reena/messageAi/ios/build/generated/ios
[Codegen] Done.
```

**Files Generated:**
- ComponentDescriptors.h/.cpp
- States.h/.cpp
- ShadowNodes.h/.cpp
- Props.h/.cpp
- EventEmitters.h/.cpp
- RCTComponentViewHelpers.h

Also generated for:
- rnasyncstorage
- rnreanimated
- safeareacontext
- rnworklets

**Result:** ✅ ReactCodegen target compiled successfully

**Learning:**
- Expo SDK 54's codegen build phase may not run reliably during Xcode builds
- Manual codegen generation is a reliable workaround
- The codegen script discovers all New Architecture components automatically

### 6. Bug #4: ExpoModulesCore Swift Module Not Found ❌ **BLOCKER**

**Error:**
```
(/Users/reena/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MessageAI-.../ExpoModulesCore.private.swiftinterface:11:19)

   9 | import CryptoKit
  10 | import Dispatch
> 11 | @_exported import ExpoModulesCore
     |                   ^ underlying Objective-C module 'ExpoModulesCore' not found
  12 | import Foundation
  13 | import ObjectiveC
  14 | import React
```

**Root Cause:**
Fundamental architectural incompatibility between:
1. **React Native Firebase** - Requires `use_frameworks! :linkage => :static` for Swift pods
2. **Expo SDK 54** - Uses precompiled XCFrameworks that are incompatible with `use_frameworks!`

**Evidence from Research:**
From Expo SDK 54 documentation:
> "Precompiled React Native for iOS is not compatible with use_frameworks!. When using use_frameworks!, React Native for iOS will always build from source."

**Attempted Fix #1:**
Added Swift compiler flags for ExpoModulesCore:

```ruby
if target.name == 'ExpoModulesCore'
  config.build_settings['OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS'] ||= '$(inherited)'
  config.build_settings['OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS'] << ' -Xcc -Wno-error=non-modular-include-in-framework-module'
  config.build_settings['DEFINES_MODULE'] = 'YES'
end
```

**Result:** ❌ Still failed with same error

**Attempted Fix #2:**
Checked ExpoModulesCore modulemap and headers:

```bash
cat ios/Pods/Target\ Support\ Files/ExpoModulesCore/ExpoModulesCore.modulemap
# module ExpoModulesCore {
#   umbrella header "ExpoModulesCore-umbrella.h"
#   export *
#   module * { export * }
# }

ls ios/Pods/Headers/Public/ExpoModulesCore/
# Headers exist and are properly linked
```

**Result:** ❌ Module structure is correct, but Swift still can't find it

**Investigation Notes:**
During pod install, saw interesting output:
```
[Expo] Disabling USE_FRAMEWORKS for modules ExpoModulesCore, Expo, ReactAppDependencyProvider, expo-dev-menu
```

This indicates Expo tries to work around the use_frameworks issue for specific modules, but it's not sufficient when Firebase requires use_frameworks globally.

**Result:** ❌ **UNRESOLVED** - Build exits with error code 65

**Learning:**
- React Native Firebase + Expo SDK 54 have a fundamental architectural conflict
- Firebase's Swift dependencies require `use_frameworks!`
- Expo's precompiled XCFrameworks break when `use_frameworks!` is enabled
- This is not a bug we can fix - it's a compatibility gap between two different architectural approaches

---

## Technical Deep Dive

### Why React Native Firebase Needs use_frameworks!

Firebase iOS SDK is written in Swift and Objective-C. The Swift portions require:
1. Static framework linking for module definitions
2. Modular headers for proper Swift/ObjC interop
3. Framework module maps for import resolution

Without `use_frameworks!`, the Swift modules cannot be properly imported by other Swift code.

### Why Expo SDK 54 Conflicts with use_frameworks!

Expo SDK 54 introduced a major optimization:
- Ships React Native as **precompiled XCFrameworks**
- Reduces clean build time from 120s to 10s
- XCFrameworks are pre-built binaries optimized for specific configurations

**The Problem:**
When `use_frameworks!` is enabled, Xcode expects ALL dependencies to be frameworks. But:
1. Expo's precompiled XCFrameworks have specific linking requirements
2. The framework bundling process breaks Expo's module resolution
3. ExpoModulesCore can't be found because it's compiled differently than expected

This creates a **catch-22**:
- ✅ Enable `use_frameworks!` → Firebase works, Expo breaks
- ✅ Disable `use_frameworks!` → Expo works, Firebase breaks

---

## What Worked

### ✅ Source Code Migration
- Clean API conversion from JS SDK to RN Firebase
- All business logic working correctly
- Type safety maintained with FirebaseAuthTypes

### ✅ Test Coverage
- 16/16 tests passing
- Unit tests: authStore (7 tests)
- Integration tests: auth flows (6 tests)
- Config tests: Firebase initialization (3 tests)

### ✅ Firebase Configuration
- Offline persistence configured
- Unlimited cache size set
- Server timestamps working
- Firestore collections properly structured

### ✅ Build Fixes (Partial)
- React Native header imports resolved
- Swift modular headers enabled
- Codegen artifacts generated
- RNFB* targets compiling

---

## What Didn't Work

### ❌ ExpoModulesCore Compatibility
**Root Cause:** Architectural incompatibility
**Impact:** iOS builds fail, app cannot launch
**Workaround:** None found

### ❌ Prebuild Attempts
- `npx expo prebuild --clean` reset Podfile, lost Firebase configuration
- Manual Podfile edits required after every prebuild

### ❌ Building React Native from Source
**Not Attempted:** Would require:
- Setting `ios.buildReactNativeFromSource: true` in Podfile.properties.json
- Losing the 10x build speed improvement from precompiled XCFrameworks
- Still uncertain if it would resolve ExpoModulesCore issue

---

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Build React Native from Source
**Pros:**
- Might resolve use_frameworks compatibility
- More flexibility in build configuration

**Cons:**
- Loses Expo SDK 54's main performance benefit
- Build times increase from 10s to 120s
- Still uncertain to work
- Not tested

### 2. Wait for Upstream Fixes
**Observation:** This is a known compatibility gap

**Potential Solutions:**
- Expo SDK 55 may improve framework compatibility
- React Native Firebase v24+ may add better Expo support
- React Native 0.82+ may have architectural changes

**Cons:**
- Timeline unknown
- May never be resolved if architectural approaches diverge

### 3. Use Firebase JS SDK (CHOSEN)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Works perfectly with Expo SDK 54
- ✅ No native build complexity
- ✅ Fully functional offline support
- ✅ Well-tested and stable
- ✅ Meets all project requirements

**Cons:**
- Slightly larger bundle size
- Doesn't use native Firebase SDK features

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. New Architecture is Non-Negotiable
When using expo-router with Expo SDK 54:
- react-native-reanimated v4+ is required
- reanimated v4+ mandates New Architecture
- Cannot be disabled without breaking navigation

### 2. Bleeding Edge Tech Has Risks
- Expo SDK 54 (released Sep 2025) + React Native 0.81 is very new
- React Native Firebase v23 + New Architecture is experimental
- Combining multiple bleeding-edge technologies multiplies compatibility risks

### 3. Firebase JS SDK is Production-Ready
Despite being "just JavaScript":
- Full offline persistence support
- Proper TypeScript types
- Excellent Expo compatibility
- Battle-tested in production

### 4. Native Modules Add Complexity
React Native Firebase benefits:
- Native performance (marginal in practice)
- Native push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- Native analytics

But requires:
- Custom dev client (can't use Expo Go)
- Complex native build configuration
- Platform-specific troubleshooting
- Longer build times

### 5. Prebuild Resets Configuration
Running `npx expo prebuild --clean`:
- Regenerates ios/ and android/ directories
- **Overwrites Podfile** with defaults
- Loses all custom native configuration
- Must reapply fixes after every prebuild

### 6. Codegen Can Fail Silently
The `[Expo Autolinking] Run Codegen with autolinking` build phase:
- May run without errors
- But not actually generate files
- Requires manual verification
- Manual generation is more reliable

---
