# PR Implementation Prompts

This folder contains step-by-step implementation guides for each Pull Request.

## ðŸ“‹ How to Use These Prompts

Each PR prompt is a **complete, self-contained implementation guide** including:
- âœ… Context files to read
- âœ… What already exists (code reuse)
- âœ… Clear granular tasks
- âœ… Tests to write (TDD approach)
- âœ… Patterns to follow
- âœ… Integration points
- âœ… Success criteria

**Workflow:**
1. Read the PR prompt completely
2. Read all context files listed at top
3. Follow tasks sequentially
4. Write tests FIRST (TDD)
5. Implement code
6. Verify all tests pass
7. Complete success criteria checklist
8. Commit with provided template
