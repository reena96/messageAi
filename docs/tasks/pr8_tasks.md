## ✅ Task Breakdown

### **Task 1: Create RSVP Tracking Cloud Function**
**Time:** 1.5 hours
**Action:** CREATE Cloud Function for RSVP detection

#### Subtask 1.1: Create `functions/src/ai/rsvpTracking.ts`
- [ ] Create new file: `functions/src/ai/rsvpTracking.ts`
- [ ] Import dependencies
- [ ] Define secret: `const openaiApiKey = defineSecret('OPENAI_API_KEY')`
- [ ] Define `RSVP` interface:
  - [ ] `isInvitation: boolean` (is this an invitation?)
  - [ ] `isResponse: boolean` (is this an RSVP response?)
  - [ ] `event?: string` (what event is it for)
  - [ ] `response?: 'yes' | 'no' | 'maybe'` (user's response)
  - [ ] `responses?: { yes: number, no: number, maybe: number }` (aggregate counts)
  - [ ] `details?: string` (additional context)
  - [ ] `confidence: number` (0-1 range)
- [ ] Implement `trackRSVP` callable function:
  - [ ] Accept parameters: `{ text: string, chatId?: string, messageId?: string }`
  - [ ] Validate: text not empty
  - [ ] Initialize OpenAI client
  - [ ] Create system prompt:
    ```
    "You are an AI assistant that tracks RSVPs and invitations for events.

    Detect two types of messages:
    1. INVITATIONS: Messages inviting people to events
       - Extract: event name/description, any details
       - Set isInvitation=true

    2. RSVP RESPONSES: Messages responding to invitations
       - Detect: yes ('I'll be there', 'count me in'), no ('can't make it', 'sorry'), maybe ('might come', 'not sure')
       - Set isResponse=true, response=yes/no/maybe

    Return JSON with: isInvitation, isResponse, event, response, details, confidence.
    Confidence: 1.0 = certain, 0.5 = uncertain.
    Only mark as invitation/response if confidence > 0.7."
    ```
  - [ ] Call OpenAI Chat Completion API:
    - Model: `gpt-4-turbo-preview`
    - Temperature: 0.3
    - Response format: JSON object
  - [ ] Parse and validate response
  - [ ] If chatId and messageId provided:
    - [ ] Query previous messages in chat to aggregate RSVP counts
    - [ ] Count yes/no/maybe responses
    - [ ] Add to response: `responses: { yes: X, no: Y, maybe: Z }`
  - [ ] Return: `{ rsvp: RSVP }`
  - [ ] Handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Export function with secret dependency

**Pattern:** Same as previous AI functions
**Special Feature:** Aggregates RSVP counts across chat history

#### Subtask 1.2: Modify `functions/src/index.ts`
- [ ] Export RSVP tracking:
  ```typescript
  export { trackRSVP } from './ai/rsvpTracking';
  ```

#### Subtask 1.3: Deploy Function
- [ ] Build: `cd functions && npm run build`
- [ ] Deploy: `firebase deploy --only functions:trackRSVP`
- [ ] Test in Firebase Console
- [ ] Verify: Detects invitations and responses

---

### **Task 2: Create Deadline Extraction Cloud Function**
**Time:** 1 hour
**Action:** CREATE Cloud Function for deadline detection

#### Subtask 2.1: Create `functions/src/ai/deadlineExtraction.ts`
- [ ] Create new file: `functions/src/ai/deadlineExtraction.ts`
- [ ] Import dependencies
- [ ] Define secret
- [ ] Define `Deadline` interface:
  - [ ] `task: string` (what needs to be done)
  - [ ] `dueDate: string` (ISO format YYYY-MM-DD)
  - [ ] `dueTime?: string` (time if specified)
  - [ ] `assignedTo?: string[]` (who is responsible)
  - [ ] `priority?: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'`
  - [ ] `completed: boolean` (default false)
  - [ ] `confidence: number` (0-1 range)
- [ ] Implement `extractDeadlines` callable function:
  - [ ] Accept parameters: `{ text: string }`
  - [ ] Validate: text not empty
  - [ ] Initialize OpenAI client
  - [ ] Create system prompt:
    ```
    "You are an AI assistant that extracts deadlines and tasks from messages.

    Deadlines are TASKS with DUE DATES, different from calendar EVENTS:
    - 'Permission slip due Friday' → Deadline (task to complete)
    - 'Meeting Friday at 3pm' → Event (not a deadline)

    Extract: task description, due date (ISO format), due time if mentioned, priority.
    Priority: high (due today/tomorrow), medium (this week), low (later).

    Return JSON array with: task, dueDate, dueTime, priority, confidence.
    Confidence: 1.0 = certain, 0.5 = uncertain.
    Only include items with confidence > 0.6."
    ```
  - [ ] Call OpenAI Chat Completion API:
    - Model: `gpt-4-turbo-preview`
    - Temperature: 0.3
    - Response format: JSON object
  - [ ] Parse and validate response
  - [ ] Filter deadlines with confidence > 0.6
  - [ ] Return: `{ deadlines: Deadline[] }`
  - [ ] Handle errors: return empty array
- [ ] Export function

**Pattern:** Similar to calendarExtraction
**Key Difference:** Distinguishes deadlines (tasks) from events (appointments)

#### Subtask 2.2: Modify `functions/src/index.ts`
- [ ] Export deadline extraction:
  ```typescript
  export { extractDeadlines } from './ai/deadlineExtraction';
  ```

#### Subtask 2.3: Deploy Function
- [ ] Build and deploy
- [ ] Test in Firebase Console
- [ ] Verify: Extracts deadlines, distinguishes from events

---

### **Task 3: Create Client-side AI Modules**
**Time:** 45 minutes
**Action:** CREATE client wrappers

#### Subtask 3.1: Create `lib/ai/rsvp.ts`
- [ ] Create new file: `lib/ai/rsvp.ts`
- [ ] Define `RSVP` interface (same as Cloud Function)
- [ ] Implement `trackRSVP(text: string, chatId?: string, messageId?: string)`:
  - [ ] Get callable reference
  - [ ] Call Cloud Function with all params
  - [ ] Return RSVP object
  - [ ] Handle errors: return null
- [ ] Create `RSVP_TEST_CASES` array (20+ test cases):
  - [ ] "Pizza party Friday! Who's coming?" → invitation
  - [ ] "Count me in!" → yes response
  - [ ] "Sorry, can't make it" → no response
  - [ ] "I'll try to come but not sure" → maybe response
  - [ ] "What time should we meet?" → not an RSVP
  - [ ] Edge cases for accuracy validation
- [ ] Export function, type, test cases

#### Subtask 3.2: Create `lib/ai/deadlines.ts`
- [ ] Create new file: `lib/ai/deadlines.ts`
- [ ] Define `Deadline` interface
- [ ] Implement `extractDeadlines(text: string)`:
  - [ ] Get callable reference
  - [ ] Call Cloud Function
  - [ ] Return deadlines array
  - [ ] Handle errors: return empty array
- [ ] Create `DEADLINE_TEST_CASES` array (20+ test cases):
  - [ ] "Permission slip due Friday by 5pm" → deadline with time
  - [ ] "Report due tomorrow" → high priority deadline
  - [ ] "Submit proposal by end of month" → medium priority
  - [ ] "Meeting Friday at 3pm" → NOT a deadline (it's an event)
  - [ ] Edge cases for deadline vs event distinction
- [ ] Export function, type, test cases

**Pattern:** Same as previous AI modules

---

### **Task 4: Complete Multi-Feature Extraction Pipeline**

    ```typescript
    Promise.all([
      extractCalendarEvents(text),
      extractDecisions(text),
      detectPriority(text),
      trackRSVP(text, chatId, messageId),
      extractDeadlines(text)
    ])
      .then(([calendarEvents, decisions, priority, rsvp, deadlines]) => {
        const aiExtraction: any = { extractedAt: new Date() };

        if (calendarEvents.length > 0) aiExtraction.calendarEvents = calendarEvents;
        if (decisions.length > 0) aiExtraction.decisions = decisions;
        if (priority) aiExtraction.priority = priority;
        if (rsvp && (rsvp.isInvitation || rsvp.isResponse)) aiExtraction.rsvp = rsvp;
        if (deadlines.length > 0) aiExtraction.deadlines = deadlines;

        // Link RSVP to calendar event if both exist
        if (rsvp?.isInvitation && calendarEvents.length > 0) {
          aiExtraction.relatedItems = {
            rsvpLinkedToEvent: calendarEvents[0].event
          };
        }

        firestore()
          .collection('chats').doc(chatId)
          .collection('messages').doc(messageId)
          .update({ aiExtraction });
      })
      .catch(err => console.log('AI extraction failed:', err));
    ```
  - [ ] Add relatedItems linking logic
  - [ ] Don't block message send

**Pattern:** Complete 5-feature parallel extraction
**New Feature:** Related items linking (RSVP ↔ Calendar)

    relatedItems?: {
      rsvpLinkedToEvent?: string;

- [ ] Update `renderItem` function:
  - [ ] Handle both CalendarEvent and Deadline types
  - [ ] Show icon: 📅 for events, ⏰ for deadlines
  - [ ] For deadlines: show countdown ("Due in 2 days", "Overdue by 1 day")
  - [ ] For deadlines: show priority badge
  - [ ] For deadlines: show completion status (checkmark if done)
