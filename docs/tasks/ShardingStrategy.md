# Implementation Guide Sharding Plan

## Overview

The original 04-implementation-guide.md (85KB) has been sharded into focused, context-aware documents with **integrated test coverage** for automated verification.

## Shard Structure

### 📁 Shard 1: Foundation (PR #1)
**File:** `06-implementation-foundation.md`
**Focus:** Project setup + Authentication
**Timeline:** 2-3 hours
**Test Coverage:** Unit + Integration

**Why tests here:**
- ✅ Authentication is critical - must work correctly
- ✅ authStore logic needs unit tests
- ✅ Complete auth flow needs integration tests
- ✅ Tests verify Firebase connection

**Tests included:**
- Firebase configuration tests
- authStore unit tests (signUp, signIn, signOut)
- Auth flow integration tests
- Error handling tests

---

### 📁 Shard 2: Core Messaging (PR #2-3)
**File:** `07-implementation-core-messaging.md`
**Focus:** UI/Navigation + Real-time messaging
**Timeline:** 11-14 hours (4-5h + 7-9h)
**Test Coverage:** Unit + Integration + Performance

**Why tests here:**
- ✅ Messaging is THE core feature - must be bulletproof
- ✅ messageStore logic is complex (optimistic UI)
- ✅ Real-time sync must be verified
- ✅ Performance targets must be measured

**Tests included:**
- messageStore unit tests (sendMessage, markAsRead)
- Real-time listener tests
- Message send/receive integration tests
- Optimistic UI tests
- Performance benchmarks (<200ms target)
- 20-message stress test

---

### 📁 Shard 3: Resilience (PR #4-5 + MVP Checkpoint)
**File:** `08-implementation-resilience.md`
**Focus:** Offline support + Group chat + Push notifications
**Timeline:** 10-13 hours (5-7h + 5-6h)
**Test Coverage:** Integration + E2E

**Why tests here:**
- ✅ Offline is a RUBRIC REQUIREMENT - must pass 7 scenarios
- ✅ Group chat builds on messaging - integration tests critical
- ✅ Push notifications need end-to-end verification

**Tests included:**
- 7 offline scenario tests (automated + manual)
- Offline sync performance test (<1s target)
- Group chat integration tests
- Push notification delivery tests
- MVP checkpoint validation (all 11 requirements)

---

### 📁 Shard 4: AI Features (PR #6-8)
**File:** `09-implementation-ai-features.md`
**Focus:** AI infrastructure + 5 required AI features
**Timeline:** 12-15 hours (4-5h + 4-5h + 4-5h)
**Test Coverage:** Accuracy + Integration

**Why tests here:**
- ✅ AI accuracy >90% is RUBRIC REQUIREMENT
- ✅ Each AI feature must be validated with test cases
- ✅ Prompt engineering verification needed

**Tests included:**
- Calendar extraction accuracy tests (>90% target)
- Decision summarization accuracy tests
- Priority detection accuracy tests
- RSVP tracking accuracy tests
- Deadline extraction accuracy tests
- AI processing performance tests (<2s target)
- Integration tests for AI data flow

---

### 📁 Shard 5: Advanced & Polish (PR #9-11)
**File:** `10-implementation-advanced.md`
**Focus:** Proactive Assistant + Performance + Testing + Bonus
**Timeline:** 17-23 hours
**Test Coverage:** Advanced AI + E2E + Performance

**Why tests here:**
- ✅ Proactive Assistant is complex (LangChain + RAG)
- ✅ Performance optimization needs benchmarks
- ✅ Final E2E validation before submission

**Tests included:**
- Proactive Assistant accuracy tests
- LangChain chain execution tests
- Performance optimization benchmarks
- E2E app flow tests
- Bonus feature tests (if implemented)

---

### 📁 Testing Strategy
**File:** `11-testing-strategy.md`
**Focus:** Comprehensive testing guide
**Timeline:** Reference throughout development

**Contents:**
- Testing philosophy
- Unit vs Integration vs E2E
- Test-driven development workflow
- Running tests in CI/CD
- Coverage requirements
- Performance testing
- Manual testing checklists

---

| Foundation | #1 | ✅ authStore | ✅ Auth flow | - | - |
| Core Messaging | #2-3 | ✅ messageStore | ✅ Real-time sync | - | - |
| Resilience | #4-5 | - | ✅ Group chat | ✅ 7 offline scenarios | - |
| AI Features | #6-8 | - | ✅ AI data flow | - | ✅ All 5 features |
| Advanced | #9-11 | ✅ LangChain | ✅ Advanced AI | ✅ Full app | ✅ Proactive AI |

**Total test count:** ~60+ automated tests + manual validation checklists

## How to Use These Shards

### Sequential Development
```bash
# Week structure:
Day 1: 06-implementation-foundation.md (PR #1)
       07-implementation-core-messaging.md (PR #2-3)

Day 2: 08-implementation-resilience.md (PR #4-5)
       MVP Checkpoint validation

Day 3: 09-implementation-ai-features.md (PR #6-8)

Day 4: 10-implementation-advanced.md (PR #9-11)
       Final testing & deployment
```

### Parallel Development (if multiple developers)
```bash
Developer 1: Foundation → Core Messaging
Developer 2: (waits) → AI Features (can start after PR #3)
Developer 3: (waits) → Advanced & Polish (can start after PR #8)
```

### Test-Driven Workflow

For each shard:
1. Read the implementation guide
2. **Run existing tests first** (if any dependencies)
3. **Write tests for new functionality** (TDD approach)
4. Implement the code
5. **Verify all tests pass**
6. Run manual verification checklist
7. Commit with test results in commit message

## Cross-References

Each shard links to:
- Technical Architecture (data models, security rules)
- Messaging Infrastructure (for PR #2-5)
- Rubric Alignment (for validation)
- Previous/Next shards (navigation)

---

## Benefits of This Structure

### ✅ For Coding Agents
- Clear scope per document
- Integrated test validation
- Verification criteria for each PR
- Can confirm code correctness via tests

### ✅ For Human Developers
- Focused reading (10-20KB vs 85KB)
- Context-aware grouping
- Tests serve as documentation
- Clear success criteria

### ✅ For Project Management
- Accurate time estimates per shard
- Test pass/fail = done/not done
- Easy to track progress
- Clear dependencies

## File Sizes

```
06-implementation-foundation.md        ~25KB  (PR #1 + tests)
07-implementation-core-messaging.md    ~40KB  (PR #2-3 + tests)
08-implementation-resilience.md        ~35KB  (PR #4-5 + MVP + tests)
09-implementation-ai-features.md       ~45KB  (PR #6-8 + accuracy tests)
10-implementation-advanced.md          ~30KB  (PR #9-11 + E2E tests)
11-testing-strategy.md                 ~20KB  (testing guide)
```

Total: ~195KB (sharded) vs 85KB (original monolith)

**Why larger?** Comprehensive test code + validation steps
